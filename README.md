# Game Cards

This is yet another personal project, where I used React for building and Tailwind.css for styling. <br>
The interest towards game projects just continue...

And as always, instructions to download this project are in the end :-)

## Favorite games - from the past and the present

Wanted to make a small interactive list of my favorite games, from the past and the present. Basically the games, I believe I could come back to and play more. Or the games that just have 'special place in my heart'. Clich√© but that's how it is.

And one more gif, to show its interactivity.

Looks very nice!

## Thoughts and comments

It's been a _small_ while since my last React project, but I wanted to do something to keep my React and tailwind.css knowledge intact. And project like this, which is a small one was fitting for the role. It was fun to do and it looks clean! <br>
Also choosing the favorite games was honestly more difficult than you could imagine lol. But this list seem good for now. Also, I like many other games as well. I'm not that picky ;)<br>

On this project I also tried to experiment more with **Git** by creating a new working branch, pulling and  reverting changes. Gonna continue doing so, and maybe one day I'll create a bigger project where I'll be merging new features from feature_branch or help other devs with their public repos. That would be interesting. 

## The development

On this project I learned even more how great Tailwind.css is in styling, but it is still not very easy to use it. Good thing you can find the shorthands quickly on their official website. And that's how you would do it anyway, by 'reading' through documentation. Overall, a good project to keep skills and knowledge intact.
